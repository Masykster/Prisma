✨ About The Project

Prisma is a modern, web-based tool designed for designers, developers, and artists. Built with a focus on UI/UX aesthetics using Glassmorphism principles, Prisma makes color selection an enjoyable experience.

Unlike basic color pickers, Prisma implements complex algorithms to ensure color harmony based on standard color theory rules.

Key Features

🎨 Interactive Color Wheel: Drag and select base colors with real-time hue, saturation, and lightness adjustments.

📐 Harmony Modes: Instantly generate palettes based on:

Monochromatic, Analogous, Complementary, Split-Complementary, Triadic, Tetradic, and Square.

🖼️ Image Extraction: Upload any image to automatically extract the 5 most dominant and aesthetic colors using quantization algorithms.

💾 Local Storage: Save your favorite palettes directly to your browser so you never lose an idea.

📋 One-Click Copy: Click any color strip to copy its HEX code instantly.

🎲 Randomizer: Stuck? Hit the randomize button for instant inspiration.
